===============================================
FORWARD AND BACKWARD SEARCH WITH LYX AND EVINCE
===============================================

For the forward and backwards (reverse) search feature in general, please refer to
Help > Additional Features, sec. 5.6 and 5.7 in LyX.


SETUP
=====

* Install the files evince_sync_lyx, evince_forward_search and evince_backward_search
  in your binary directory (e.g., ~/bin).

* Assure all three files are executable.

* In LyX, go to Tools > Preferences ... > File Handling > File Formats > Format, select
  the appropriate output format [e.g., PDF (pdflatex)], set "Viewer" to "Custom" and
  enter evince_sync_lyx as custom viewer (in the field right to the combo box).
  Hit "Apply" and "Save".

* Go to Tools > Preferences ... > Output > General and enter the following PDF command
  to Forward Search: evince_forward_search "$$o" $$n "$$f"
  Again, hit "Apply" and "Save".

Forward and Backward search should work now (backward search from within evince is triggered
by <Shift> + <Left Click>).


HISTORY
=======

The scripts have been initially developed by Benjamin Kellermann (2011) as a derivation
of gedit-synctex-plugin by José Aliste (https://github.com/jaliste/gedit-synctex-plugin,
2010) and published on https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1716268.

The work is based on a further derivation of this work for Sublime Text LaTeX Tools
(https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools/tree/master/evince).

Adaptations for the use with LyX and the tranformation of the original evince_sync bash
script to a python script (evince_sync_lyx) have been done by Jürgen Spitzmüller
<spitz@lyx.org> in 2017. 


CONTACT
=======

Please send bug reports and suggestions (related to LyX-evince synchronization) to
lyx-devel@lists.lyx.org. 
Usage questions should be addressed at lyx-users@lists.lyx.org.
