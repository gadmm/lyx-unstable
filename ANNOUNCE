Public release of LyX version 2.3.0alpha1
========================================

We are proud to announce the first public alpha of the new LyX 2.3 series.

With this release, LyX celebrates 21 years of existence. The 2.3 series
has a rich set of new features compared to the current stable series.

LyX 2.3.0alpha1 is the culmination of one year of hard work. An overview
of the new features can be found here:

You can download LyX 2.3.0alpha1 from ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/devel/.

We hope you will enjoy the result!

The file lib/RELEASE-NOTES lists some known issues and problems compared
to the current stable releases (LyX 2.2.x). We strongly recommend that
packagers of LyX on various platforms and distributions read this file.

As with any major release, this one comes with a lot of new features but
also some bugs. If you think you have found a bug in LyX 2.3.0alpha1, either
