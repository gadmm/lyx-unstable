Public release of LyX version 2.3.0beta1
========================================

We are proud to announce the first public beta of the new LyX 2.3 series.
This pre-release is meant for testing and should not be used for serious work.
For curious users who would like to test in order to help catch bugs before
the 2.3.0 release, please back up all of your documents and be prepared for
the worst to happen. Most users (who desire a stable LyX version) should not
use this pre-release.

The 2.3 series has a rich set of new features compared to the current stable
series. An overview of the new features can be found here:

  http://wiki.lyx.org/LyX/NewInLyX23

You can download LyX 2.3.0beta1 from ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/devel/.

We appreciate your help in testing this pre-release!

The file lib/RELEASE-NOTES lists some known issues and problems compared
to the current stable releases (LyX 2.2.x). We strongly recommend that
packagers of LyX on various platforms and distributions read this file.

As with any major release, this one comes with a lot of new features but
also some bugs. If you think you have found a bug in LyX 2.3.0beta1, either
email the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel at lists.lyx.org),
or open a bug report at http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome.
Please specify if the behavior you are reporting is different from behavior
in a previous LyX version.

If you have trouble using LyX or have a question, consult the
documentation that comes with LyX (under Help) and the LyX wiki, which you
will find at http://wiki.lyx.org/. You can also send email to the LyX users'
list (lyx-users at lists.lyx.org).

The LyX team.
