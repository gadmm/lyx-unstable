Compiling LyX 2.3 for Win32 and creating Windows installer
==========================================================

It's recommended to compile LyX using Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 and CMake.


Compiling with Microsoft Visual C++
===================================

	These instructions assume the LyX source code is in C:\LyX\lyx-23
	You can also use another directory if you prefer.

1	Install MSVC 2015

	If you don't have Visual C++ 2015 installed, get the free Community edition
	from https://www.visualstudio.com/

2	Install Qt

	Download the latest Qt for Open Source C++ development on Windows (VS2015)
	from https://qt.io/download-open-source/
	Qt 5.6.x is recommended, but 5.7.x or later versions should work as well.
	Make sure that the bin subfolder of the Qt installation (e.g.
	C:\Qt\Qt5.6.1\5.6\msvc2015\bin) is listed in the PATH environment variable.

3	Install Python

	Install the latest Python 2.x or 3.x version from
	https://www.python.org/downloads/

4	Install CMake

	Install the latest CMake from http://www.cmake.org

5	Configure

	- Open the "Developer Command Prompt for VS2015" from the
	  "Visual Studio 2015\Visual Studio Tools" subfolder of the start menu.
	  Run the CMake GUI from the command window that was opened.
 	  Alternatively, you can create a .bat file that first contains the line
	  call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x86
	  and then calls the CMake GUI and use this .bat file to start CMake.
	  The MSVC 2015 command prompt or vcvarsall.bat set some environment
	  variables that are needed for CMake to find the compiler.

	- Set the source code path to C:\LyX\lyx-23
	  Set the build path to C:\LyX\lyx-23-build
	  Click Configure and set the generator to Visual Studio 14.

	- Enable LYX_DEPENDENCIES_DOWNLOAD and click Configure.
	  Pre-compiled dependencies will automatically be downloaded.

	- Enable the LYX_INSTALL option, set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to
	  C:\LyX\lyx-23-install and click Configure.

	- Check the Advanced checkbox.
	  Set GETTEXT_MSGFMT_EXECUTABLE to
	  C:\LyX\lyx-23-build\msvc2015-deps\lyx-windows-deps-msvc2015\gettext-tools\msgfmt.exe,
	  and do the same for the other gettext tools.

	- Click Generate.

6	Compile

	A Microsoft Visual C++ solution should have been generated at
	C:\LyX\lyx-23-build\lyx.sln
	Compile the INSTALL project to get a LyX installation in
	C:\LyX\lyx-23-install

7	Copy dependencies

	Copy
	- C:\LyX\lyx-23-build\msvc2015-deps\lyx-windows-deps-msvc2015\bin
	- C:\LyX\lyx-23-build\msvc2015-deps\lyx-windows-deps-msvc2015\imagemagick
	- C:\LyX\lyx-23-build\msvc2015-deps\lyx-windows-deps-msvc2015\python
	- C:\LyX\lyx-23-build\msvc2015-deps\lyx-windows-deps-msvc2015\ghostscript
	- C:\LyX\lyx-23-build\msvc2015-deps\lyx-windows-deps-msvc2015\Resources
	to C:\LyX\lyx-23-install

	And copy from the Qt bin directory
	(e.g. C:\Qt\bin)
	QtCore5.dll
	QtGui5.dll
	QtCore5d.dll (if compiling Debug version)
	QtGui5d.dll (if compiling Debug version)
	to C:\LyX\lyx-23-install\bin

8	Define path prefix

	Add the following line to C:\LyX\lyx-23-install\Resources\lyxrc.dist,
	so LyX will find the bundled tools such as Python, ImageMagick
	and Ghostscript:

	\path_prefix "$LyXDir\bin;$LyXDir\python;$LyXDir\imagemagick;$LyXDir\ghostscript"

	You may also add the location of your LaTeX installation if it's not on the
	system PATH, and the location of JabRef.

9	Start LyX

	C:\LyX\lyx-23-install\bin\lyx.exe


Creating the Installer
======================

	- Get NSIS from http://nsis.sourceforge.net
	- In the LyX source directory, go to development\Win32\packaging\installer
	- Copy the 3 dll-files from there to the DLL folder of the NSIS installation
	- Check whether the file locations/paths in settings.nsh match your setup.
	- Right-click on lyx.nsi and click "Compile NSIS Script".


Compiling with GCC with MinGW64 + MSYS2 Environment using autotools
===================================================================
1	Install MSYS2, MINGW64, Qt5+
	https://wiki.qt.io/MSYS2
2	Install bc (Bench calculater), which autotools uses for some reason to compile LyX
	pacman -S bc
3	Run the standard autotools install (Adapt paths and arguments accordingly)
	./autogen.sh
	 ./configure --without-x --enable-qt5 --disable-debug --enable-optimization --prefix=/mingw64
	make
	make install


Cross-Compiling on unix with MXE using autotools
=================================================
1	Install MXE: http://mxe.cc
	You can either install from sources, the generic .tar binaries or debian .deb packages.
	Installing the following .deb packages will drag in all needed dependencies:
		mxe-x86-64-w64-mingw32.shared-file
		mxe-x86-64-w64-mingw32.shared-gcc
		mxe-x86-64-w64-mingw32.shared-libiconv
		mxe-x86-64-w64-mingw32.shared-qtimageformats
		mxe-x86-64-w64-mingw32.shared-qtsvg
		mxe-x86-64-w64-mingw32.shared-qtwinextras
	Of course you can also use the static and/or 32bit versions.
2	Run the standard autotools install (Adapt paths and arguments accordingly)
	./autogen.sh
	mkdir builddir-mingw
	cd builddir-mingw
	PATH="/usr/lib/mxe/usr/bin:$PATH" ../configure --host=x86-64-w64-mingw32.shared --with-qt-dir=/usr/lib/mxe/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32.shared/qt5 --enable-qt5 --with-included-boost --with-included-hunspell --with-included-mythes --disable-debug --enable-optimization --prefix=/mingw64
	PATH="/usr/lib/mxe/usr/bin:$PATH" make
	PATH="/usr/lib/mxe/usr/bin:$PATH" DESTDIR=/tmp/lyxinstall make install
	This uses the paths from the 64bit shared MXE version installed from .deb packages.
3	If you want to run the resulting lyx.exe from the build directory using wine,
	create symlinks for all needed .dlls:
	cd builddir-mingw/src
	ln -s /usr/lib/mxe/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32.shared/bin/*.dll .
	ln -s /usr/lib/mxe/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32.shared/qt5/bin/*.dll .
	wine64 lyx.exe
