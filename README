What is LyX unstable?

    LyX unstable is a branch of LyX master that reads, edits and writes the
    current LyX stable file format. See the documentation at
    development/unstable/unstable.lyx for more information on the why and how.
    LyX unstable edits LyX files with the 2.2 file format and follows the
    current master branch (2.4dev). When LyX 2.3 releases, unstable will be
    reset to the LyX 2.3 format.

What is LyX?

    LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to
    writing based on the structure of your documents, not their
    appearance. It is released under a Free Software / Open Source
    license.

    LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great,
    right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
    details, 'finger painting' font attributes or futzing around with
    page boundaries. You just write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's
    legendary TeX typesetting engine makes you look good.

    On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output
    -- or richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced --
    looks like nothing else. Gone are the days of industrially bland
    .docs, all looking similarly not-quite-right, yet coming out
    unpredictably different on different printer drivers. Gone are the
    crashes 'eating' your dissertation the evening before going to
    press.

    LyX is stable and fully featured. It is a multi-platform, fully
    internationalized application running natively on Unix/Linux and
    the Macintosh and modern Windows platforms.
