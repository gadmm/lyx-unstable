# Juergen Spitzmueller: They do not have problems with xunicode, but without.
# The reason is that the asterisk glyph is not included in the arabic font
# (Scheherazade), but apparently, xunicode defines an extra asterisk
# glyph (for a different purpose) that is being used here. Clearly the
# problem should be fixed somewhere else.
