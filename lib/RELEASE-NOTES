!Important Changes in LyX 2.3.0


!!Interface changes

* LyX now has "inverted" branch insets, which output their contents just in 
  case a given branch is not "activated". This makes inclusion of alternate
  material in different versions easier.

* When inserting a command or symbol in mathed, it is now automatically
  wrapped in a real inset (either \text or \ensuremath) assuring the correct
  mode, instead of being wrapped only in the output. The wrapping inset can
  be safely dissolved, as it will be automatically inserted at export time
  if needed, as usual.


!!!The following pref variables were added in 2.3:


!!!The following pref variables were changed in 2.3:

* \document_path
  Default is changed to ".". The best guess for where the user wants to save
  or find files is the directory the user started LyX from. Before, the
  default was always the home directory. If desired, the old behavior can be
  restored by changing the default path in Preferences > "Working directory".


!!!The following pref variables are obsoleted in 2.3:


!!!The following new LyX functions have been introduced in 2.3:

* branch-invert
  Toggles inversion status of branch inset.

* lyx-activate
  Activates the LyX window. Useful in combination with reverse search.


!!!The following LyX functions have been changed in 2.3:

* quote-insert
  The function now has a second and third optional argument to specify
  the side (left, right, auto) and quotation mark style (english, swedish,
  german, polish, french, danish).

* inset-modify
  This function now also applies to quote insets. It takes a three-character
  string as an argument, refering (1.) to the style (e = ``english'',
  s = ''swedish'', g = ,,german``, p = ,,polish'', f = <<french>>, a = >>danish<<),
  (2.) to the side (l = left, r = right) and (3.) to the quotation level
  (s = single, d = double). So "eld" means "English left double quotation mark".
  A dot in the string means: take the current value. So "inset-modify changetype e.."
  will only change the style to English, while letting side and level as is,
  "inset-modify changetype f.s" will change the style to French and the level to
  single, leaving the side value.

  This function is most useful when combined with inset-forall. E.g.,
  "inset-forall Quotes inset-modify changetype f.."
   => change all quote insets to French style, maintaining current side and level
  "inset-forall Quotes inset-modify changetype ..s"
   => change all quote insets to single quotes, keeping style and level
  "inset-forall Quotes inset-modify changetype g.s"
   => change all quote insets to German single quotes, keeping left/right setting


!!!The following LyX documents have been moved in 2.3:


!!!The following metadata files have been added to the tarball in 2.3:


!!Changes with respect to external programs and libraries in 2.3:
