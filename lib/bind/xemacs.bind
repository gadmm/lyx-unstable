# This is the XEMACS flavour bind file, based on the bindings found
# in the XEmacs editor. It has many bindings identical to the
# Emacs binding file although there are a few significant changes.
#
#
# DO NOT CHANGE THIS DEFAULT BINDING FILE! It will be replaced
# with every new install of LyX and your changes will be lost.
# Instead, customize a copy of this file placed in
# ~/.lyx/bind/xemacs.bind
#
# Happy tuning!
