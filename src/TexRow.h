 * When compiled in devel mode and run with the option -dbg latex, two ways
 * of debugging TexRow are available:
 *
 * 1. The source view panel prepends the full TexRow information to the LaTeX
 *    output.
 *
 * 2. Clicking on any line in the source view moves the buffer to the location
 *    recognised by TexRow.
